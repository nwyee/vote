## Use Chromedriver

You'll need ChromeDriver to control the Chrome browser. You can download it from the official chrome site. Make sure the version matches your installed version of Chrome.

* **Unzip the file** and place the executable in a directory included in your system's `PATH`, or specify the path directly in your script.
